# Lukas-Kanade-Video-Stabilization

Initial implementation of algorithms for cinemagraph generation.

Stabilization using Lukas-Kanade, automatic cropping, simple motion segmentation and feathering.

To update with: 
-the modified stabilization (Gyroscope)
-more sophisticated motion segmentation
-color transfer (ML)
-looping (SSD, triangle inequality) and frame interpolation (Farneback)
