# Lukas-Kanade-Video-Stabilization

Initial implementation of algorithms for cinemagraph generation.

Stabilization using Lukas-Kanade, automatic cropping, simple motion segmentation and feathering.

To update with:

-the modified stabilization (Gyroscope) (testing)

-more sophisticated motion segmentation (developing)

-color transfer (ML) (optimizing)

-looping (SSD, triangle inequality) and frame interpolation (Farneback) (testing)

State design pattern.
